# Sweden Age Stratified Covid Data 
Sweden does not publish their age stratified data nicely (published on weekdays as a sheet in an excel file)
Lucky [adamaltmejd](https://github.com/adamaltmejd) has been archiving it on his covid repository [here](https://github.com/adamaltmejd/covid/)
This repo takes his archives, and makes usable CSV timeseries files. For now it is just Age Stratified data, but expansion is simple. This was made mostly for creating ECV Fireplots
